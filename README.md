# Cadence Web UI

[![Build Status](https://github.com/uber/cadence-web/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/uber/cadence-web/actions/workflows/build.yml) [![Docker Status](https://github.com/uber/cadence-web/actions/workflows/docker_publish.yml/badge.svg)](https://hub.docker.com/r/ubercadence/web/tags)

Cadence is a distributed, scalable, durable, and highly available orchestration engine we developed at Uber Engineering to execute asynchronous long-running business logic in a scalable and resilient way.

This web UI is used to view workflows from [Cadence][cadence], see what's running, and explore and debug workflow executions.


## Getting Started

### Configuration

Set these environment variables if you need to change their defaults

| Variable                     | Description                                   | Default          |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| CADENCE_GRPC_PEERS           | Comma-delimited list of gRPC peers            | 127.0.0.1:7833   |
| CADENCE_GRPC_SERVICES_NAMES  | Comma-delimited list of gRPC services to call | cadence-frontend |
| CADENCE_CLUSTERS_NAMES       | Comma-delimited list of cluster names         | cluster0         |
| CADENCE_WEB_PORT             | HTTP port to serve on                         | 8088             |
| CADENCE_ADMIN_SECURITY_TOKEN | Admin token for accessing admin methods       | ''               |

Note: To connect `cadence-web` to multiple clusters, you will need to add comma-delimted entries for `CADENCE_GRPC_PEERS`, `CADENCE_GRPC_SERVICES_NAMES` & `CADENCE_CLUSTERS_NAMES` for each cluster (each cluster values are grouped by their index within the Comma-delimited lists).

Example:
```
CADENCE_GRPC_PEERS=127.0.0.1:3000,127.0.0.1:5000 
CADENCE_GRPC_SERVICES_NAMES=cadence-frontend-cluster0,cadence-frontend-cluster1
CADENCE_CLUSTERS_NAMES=cluster0,cluster1
```


### Using cadence-web

The latest version of `cadence-web` is included in the `cadence` composed docker containers in the [main Cadence repository][cadence]. Follow the instructions there to get started.
```
docker-compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up
```

### Building & developing cadence-web 

`cadence-web` requires node `v18` or greater to be able to run correctly.

#### Creating a production build

To create a production build, follow these steps:

1. Install npm packages and download idls
```
npm install && npm run install-idl && npm run generate:idl
```
2. Build the project files
```
npm run build
```
3. After building the code, start the server by running this command from the same directory as the build
```
npm start
```
4. Once the webapp is ready, access it through `localhost:8088` (port can be changed using `CADENCE_WEB_PORT` environment variable)

#### Running development environment

To run the development server, follow these steps:

1. Install npm packages and download idls
```
npm install && npm run install-idl && npm run generate:idl
```
2. Run the development server using
```
npm run dev
```
3. Once the webapp is ready, access it through `localhost:8088` (port can be changed using `CADENCE_WEB_PORT` environment variable)

Note: For contribution we recommend using dev containers, check [VSCode Dev Containers](#using-vscode-dev-containers) section for more information

#### Using VSCode Dev Containers

1. Set up the [Remote Containers plugin](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers) in VSCode.
2. Open the cadence-web directory in VSCode.
3. Make sure to update `CADENCE_GRPC_PEERS` with the correct host. (If you are connecting to a server on a container host machine use `host.docker.interal:7833`, where `7833` is the gRPC port for a running [cadence-frontend](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/tree/master/service/frontend) service)
4. Use the Command Palette to select the 'Reopen folder in Container' option
5. Follow same commands listed in [Running development environment](#running-development-environment) section.


#### Developing cadence-web against cadence composed docker

To start development against dockerized cadence services, run the following command from the root of the project
```
docker-compose -f docker-compose-backend-services.yml up
```

You can customize the YAML file or reuse configurations from the [cadence repository](https://github.com/cadence-workflow/cadence/tree/master/docker). (In case of reusing exsisting files: ensure that cadence-web is not included in the composed container services, or just remove it)

After running `cadence`, start `cadence-web` for development using one of the previous methods ([Running development environment](#running-development-environment), [VSCode Dev Containers](#using-vscode-dev-containers))
